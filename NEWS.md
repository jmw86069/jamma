# jamma version 0.0.2.900

## new functions

* `centerGeneData()` the main tool for calculations by `jammaplot()`,
centers data by subtracting the row mean or median; optionally within
groups of columns; optionally with specified control columns per
group.
* `jammaplot()` the main MA-plot function.
* `points2polygonHull()` takes a set of points and draws a polygon
hull encompassing them. It calls `rgeos::gConvexHull()`. The function
is intended to indicate the location of highlighted points on each
MA-plot panel.

## modifications

* several default settings were changed for `jammaplot()`: larger
`titleCex`; outlierColramp is NULL, in favor of using outlierColor
to change only the first color from `colramp`.
